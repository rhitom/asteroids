# Asteroids

We coded this game together and wanted to explain the process behind some of the decisions made. 

- Having a highscore AssayList intstead of a file was voluntary. Before implementing that feature we decided that we already had enough 'advanced" ones, and that a simple ArrayList would be enough, even if it goes back to zero everytime we close de GUI. 

- Not having any saucers/asteroids moving in vertical and horizontal directions was a personal preference. After spending some time playing, we noticed that having objects moving along the edges of the screen took away from the gaming experience, so we decided to change that ! 

- The saucers cannot die from their own bullets, that is also a personal choice.
